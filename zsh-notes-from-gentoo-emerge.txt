 * Messages for package app-shells/zsh-5.9-r3:

 * If you want to enable Portage completions and Gentoo prompt,
 * emerge app-shells/gentoo-zsh-completions and add
 *      autoload -U compinit promptinit
 *      compinit
 *      promptinit; prompt gentoo
 * to your ~/.zshrc
 * Also, if you want to enable cache for the completions, add
 *      zstyle ':completion::complete:*' use-cache 1
 * to your ~/.zshrc
 * Note that a system zprofile startup file is installed. This will override
 * PATH and possibly other variables that a user may set in ~/.zshenv.
 * Custom PATH settings and similar overridden variables can be moved to ~/.zprofile
 * or other user startup files that are sourced after the system zprofile.
 * If PATH must be set in ~/.zshenv to affect things like non-login ssh shells,
 * one method is to use a separate path-setting file that is conditionally sourced
 * in ~/.zshenv and also sourced from ~/.zprofile. For more information, see the
 * zshenv example in /usr/share/doc/zsh-5.9-r3/StartupFiles/.
 * See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Zsh/HOWTO for more introduction documentation.

 * Messages for package app-shells/zsh-completions-0.34.0:

 * If you happen to compile your functions, you may need to delete
 * ~/.zcompdump{,.zwc} and recompile to make the new completions available
 * to your shell.
